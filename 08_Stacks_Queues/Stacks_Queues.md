# Stacks
Is an abstract data structure that abides by a Last In First Out(LIFO) order of removal, like a stack of pancakes.

## Big O
Prioritizes insertion and removal. If you need searching and access a stack is not optimized for this.
Insertion(1)
Removal O(1)
Searching O(n)
Access O(n)

# Queue
Is an abstract data structure that abides by a First In First Out(FIFO) order of removal, like within a line of people.

## Big O
Prioritizes insertion and removal. If you need searching and access a stack is not optimized for this.
Implementing a queue with an array using shift means that the removal is actually not O(1) because of re-indexing of array values.

Insertion(1)
Removal O(1)
Searching O(n)
Access O(n)
