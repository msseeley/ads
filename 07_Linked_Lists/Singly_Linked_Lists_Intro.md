# Singly Linked Lists
A list of ordered data. The list itself contains a head, tail, and length property. The list cormprises data nodes. Each data node has a value and a pointer. The value stores data and the pointer references the next node in the list (or null if there is no next node).
- no index values for the data
- no random access => to access data, you must access the 'next' or pointer
- head and tail really serve and endpoints and help specify inwhich direction the pointers are going.

# Utility
- useful for insertion and deletion
  - compared to in an array where every other piece of data has to be re-indexed
