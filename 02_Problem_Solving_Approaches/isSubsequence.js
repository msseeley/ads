/*
IS SUBSEQUENCE
Write a function called isSubsequence, that takes in two strings and returns whether the first string is a substring of the second string. Specifically, the function should check if the characters in the first are present and in the same order of appearance as the second string.

The function MUST be at least  O(n+m)/O(1) time/space.

Test cases
  isSubsequence('hello', 'hello world') //true
  isSubsequence('sing', 'sting') //true
  isSubsequence('abc', 'abracadabra') //true
  isSubsequence('abc', 'cba') // false
