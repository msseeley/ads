# **Helpful Processes of Solving Algorithms**
_Generally targeted toward interview problem solving settings, where an interviewee is presented with a problem (they've most likely never seen) and have limited to solve it as well as demonstrate their understanding of the problem and concepts themselves._

## **The Process**
_**Understand the Problem**_
1. **Read and Rephrase**<br>
Read and rephrase the prompt to make sure you understand the question.<br>
    - What are the inputs and outputs?
    - What are the shape/form of the inputs and outputs?
    - How should you label the data that are part of this problem?

2. **Examples**<br>
Ask for or create concrete examples of inputs and outputs.
    - start with simple examples
    - progress to more complex examples
    - add on edge case examples (null values etc.)
    - explore invalid inputs

_**Break it Down**_

3. **Approach**<br>
Break down your approach to the problem.
    - can help to write pseudo code with broken down steps
    - it's possible to discuss runtime here

4. **Code**<br>
Code out your approach.
    - based on your approach/notes, code through the steps.
    - start with/prioritize the simplest parts and ignore anything too tricky
    - go back to the tricky aspects and incorporate those into the solution

5. **Test** <br>
From your given test cases, work through a test or two to see if your code work.
    - go through line by line with your test case(s)

_**Refactor**_

6. **Optimize**<br> Go through your code and if you have time, figure out places to optimize the code or at least discuss ideas for optimization.
    - can you simplify what you've written?
    - what is the Big O?
    - can you make the Big O more optimal, even just discussing?
    - if at a company, does this follow style and code guidelines?
    - how have other people solved this problem?
