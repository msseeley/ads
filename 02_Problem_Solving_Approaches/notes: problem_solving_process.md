# **Helpful Processes of Solving Algorithms**
_Generally targeted toward interview problem solving settings, where an interviewee is presented with a problem (they've most likely never seen) and have limited to solve it as well as demonstrate their understanding of the problem and concepts themselves._

Steps:
 1. Understand the Problem
 2. Explore Concrete Examples
 3. Break it down
 4. Solve/Simplify
 5. Lookback and Refactor

Another acronym for this is REACTO
1. **Read and Rephrase**<br>
Read and rephrase the prompt to make sure you understand the question.<br>
    - What are the inputs and outputs?
    - What are the shape/form of the inputs and outputs?
    - Do you have enough information to compute the outputs?
    - How should you label the data that are part of this problem?

2. **Examples**<br>
Ask for examples of inputs and outputs.

3. **Approach**<br>
Outline your approach to the problem in words, pseudo code etc.
4. **Code**<br>
Code out your approach
5. **Test** <br>
From your given test cases, work through a test or two to see if your code work
6. **Optimize**<br> Go through your code and if you have time, figure out places to optimize the code or at least discuss ideas for optimization.
