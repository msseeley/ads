# Comparing Bubble, Selection, Insertion Sorting Algorithms
Depending on what you want from the sorted data and how sorted your data is intially, different algorithms will perform better.
These algorithms tend to do well on smaller data sets and are often considered fairly equivalent in terms of runtime, though there are better cases for each.

## Mostly sorted data:
Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort do fairly well.

## Looking for the top values:
Bubble sort will order the highest value integers faster than insertion sort and selection sort.

## Simplicity of code:
Selection Sort

## When memory space is limited:
Selection Sort has fewer swaps

## Continuously added data:
Insertion Sort
