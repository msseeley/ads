# Radix Sort
Is a special sorting algorithm is applied to sorting numbers. It does not compare numbers to each other. Instead, it goes through the digits of each number (right to left). At each digit it sorts the entire array of numbers into placeholder positions based on the value of that number. When a larger digit place is visited and one of the values isn't that large (would ostesibly be 0), it is then put into the 0 placeholder (in order). When all the numbers are in the numbers are in the 0 placeholder they are ordered.
